## What is this wizardry?

> “Extra prima good, Mr Coleman, sir!”

Coleman is very own personal manbot, capable of fulfilling a number of roles and tasks with the utmost aplomb, tact and efficiency.

Simply start a conversation with Coleman and he will do his best to respond, learning where he can from whatever you choose to teach him.


## No, seriously, what the hell is going on?

> “It’s not who I am underneath, but what I do that defines me.”

Coleman is a script aggregator. Feed him scripts to increase his capabilities and then interact with him via a web-based API. Coleman strives to have a conversational API that allows you to command him as you require.

_Documentation to come shortly, although, if all goes to plan, Coleman should be able to tell you himself._
